## General 
* Use "Beads" for issue tracking - run `bd quickstart` for details. Do not modify or create files unless they have an associated Beads issue. 
* Code with TDD in mind - where possible use a test suite and write tests before implementation. 

## The Project
* This project is building a cross-platform explorer app using Tauri and Svelte. 
* Please read [Specs](@specs.md) for the specs. 
* Follow the [High level plan](@high_level_plan.md)
* Please create implementation plans before converting into issues in Beads
